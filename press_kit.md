# History

Infinite Dango Studios was founded in late January 2015. It started as a small group of highschoolers that consisted of two artists, a coder, and a writer. The four teamed up to work on developing a visual novel called 'Ganbatte'. They used the Ren'Py visual novel engine for the game. Eventually another artist and a composer joined the studio as well, to help on the development of Ganbatte.

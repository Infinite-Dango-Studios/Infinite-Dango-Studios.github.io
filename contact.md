If you need to contact Infinite Dango Studios or any of its staff members then you can do so through the studio email account. If you wish to get in contact with any specific staff member, or a specific team, then please mention that in your email.

The email account is checked on a near daily basis, so it will not likely take long to respond to your message. However, in the event that we are unable to respond to your email in a relatively timely manner, feel free to send us another email to let us know.

If you would like to report any bugs that you come across or have features that you would like to suggest, then you may want to file an issue in the GitHub repository for the game in question. Doing so does require that you make a GitHub account, but by using GitHub we will better be able to respond to your bug report or feature request. If for any reason you are unable to file an issue through GitHub, then you can feel free to send us an email instead.

If you are a member of the press emailing us to request materials on the game, feel free to look over the press kit for the [studio](/press-kit/) and [Ganbatte](/press-kit/ganbatte/) for some such resources. If you need any resources that are not provided in the press kit, send us an email and we will likely be happy to provide you with them.

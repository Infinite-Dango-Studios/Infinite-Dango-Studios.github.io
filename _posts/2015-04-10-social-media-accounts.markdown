Over the last few weeks we have been working a lot on setting up various social media accounts for the studio. We hope that by using a few different social media websites to post information about the development of Ganbatte that we will be able to reach more people who use different social media websites. We will make sure to post the most important information on the game's development here on the studio website, but we will use social media to distribute interesting, but less important details of the development.

Currently we have set up social media accounts for the studio on Facebook, Google+, and YouTube. Also some of the staff members may also use their Twitter accounts to spread some of the development details that they encounter. For a full list of the social media accounts that we are going to use to give out information on Ganbatte, please look at the footer of the website. As that list should always be up to date with the various social media accounts that will be used by the studio.
